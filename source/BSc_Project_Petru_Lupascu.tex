  \section{Introduction}
  %backstory
  \indent From the yearly days of digital television, video compression techniques gained incresed attention, mainly due to bandwidth always being 
  an expensive asset. Throughout the years, video coding techniques played a vital role in reducing the size of the video sequences without significant
  alteration of its quality. In paralel with advamcement in computer performance, video coding allowed for services such as video telephone and digital 
  televesion to be more accesible, which in turn increased the demand. As a consequence, the developement of video coding techniques was incentivised. 
  Straight Forward Pulse Code Modulation(PCM) was one of the first antepmts on coding video signals at around 140 Mbits/s. Since then video coding 
  have gone a massive progress, modern codecs being able to code Video Signals as low as 9 Mbits/s for HDV format. A newer generation codec targets 
  to achieve the same performance as the previous generation one at the half bitrate. This is done at the expensive of increasing complexity. Most of coding
  techniques require hardware implementations for optimized performance which makes standartization essential to ensure compatibility with as large amount of devices 
  as possible.\cite{stcodec}
