\section{Introduction}
%backstory
\indent From the yearly days of digital television, video compression techniques gained increased attention, mainly due to bandwidth always being
an expensive asset, fact which is relevant. Throughout the years, video coding techniques played a vital role in reducing the size of the video sequences without significant
alteration of its quality. In parallel with advancement in computer performance, video coding allowed for services such as video telephone and digital
television to be more accessible, which in turn increased the demand. As a consequence, the development of video coding techniques was incentivised.
Straight Forward Pulse Code Modulation(PCM) was one of the first attempt on coding video signals at around 140 Mbits/s. Since then video coding
have gone a massive progress, modern codecs being able to code Video Signals as low as 9 Mbits/s for HDV format. A newer generation codec targets
to achieve the same performance as the previous generation one at the half bit rate. This is done at the expensive of increasing complexity. Most of coding
techniques require hardware implementations for optimized performance which makes standardization essential to ensure compatibility with as large amount of devices
as possible.\cite{ghanbari2011standard}\\
\indent Such standards were throughout the years developed by two groups, the Video Coding Experts Group(VCEG), known for H26x family of codecs and Moving Picture Experts Group(MPEG) for MPEG-X family of codecs. A codec would be licensed to software developers and hardware manufacturers. Starting mid two thousands open source and royalty free coding standards started to be developed and gained popularity, effectively competing with the standard families mentioned above. Some of the most popular ones being the VPx family, developed by Google and On2 Technologies. \\
\indent Due to the good performance and open source nature of VPx codec family, companies, such as LogMeIn started incorporating them in their Video Conferencing software, by implementing software-based codecs. Curently, LogMeIn uses a software-based codec to to encode and decode screen content of online conferences. The codec performs compression of a screen content video stream prior of sending the stream over the internet as well as decompression of the screen content video stream on receiver side. Going forward, the current software-based video codec should be replaced by a modern real-time video codec, such as VP9. VP9 was designed around ordinary video use cases, webcam and movie video content. Libvpx, VP9’s software implementation, also focuses on these use cases with some enhancements regarding animations. Thus, in this thesis am investigating the capabilities of VP9 to encode screen content properly, outlined by evaluating the codec in terms of Bitrate, PSNR, CPU-requirements etc., evaluate VP9 with screen and regular content, uncover its weak areas and propose solutions to optimize them.

%image and video signal definition and characteristics
\section{Background and literature review}
\subsection{Digital Image and Video Signals}
\indent An Image is a projection of a 3-D scene, characterized by depth, texture and illumination, onto a 2-D plane characterized by texture and illumination
without depth information \cite[p.~5]{richardson2002video}. It may be defined as a 2 dimensional signal $ f(x, y) $, where $x$ and $y$ are spatial
coordinates and $f$ is the intensity at that point, when $x$, $y$ and $f$ are finite we call this image a Digital Image \cite[p.~1]{gonzalez2008digital}.
Therefore, a Video represents a sequence of images over a period of time and can be defined as $f(x,y,t)$, where $x$, $y$, $f$ are spatial and intensity values
and $t$ is the time.
For the sake of simplicity we will call the two dimensional point a pixel and its intensity pixel value and each image in a video sequence frame.
Furthermore, an image can be characterized in terms of its resolution and colour format, for the video, additionally there is length. The resolution
commonly describes the amount of pixels present in the image, for example: 740x480. The colour format represents a typical arrangement of colours in an image such as Grayscale
where the pixels value represents the light intensity(luminance) information, commonly 0 to 255 for an 8 bit image. Other important colour formats are the YUV and RGB, where the
image is divided into three sub planes containing luminance, red chrominance and blue chrominance values for YUV and Red, Green and Blue colour intensity values for RGB. Usually 8
bits values per sub plane pixel   are used. Generally, all the parameters mentioned depend on the particular application. However, in most of cases, the amount of data required to
store or transmit a video or an image tend to be very large. A two-hour Standard Definition(SD) 720x480x24 bits per frame movie, displayed at 30 frames per second must be accessed
at $ 31,104,000 $ bytes/sec
and would require roughly $224 GB$ of data and it gets much larger in case of High Definition (HD) videos where the resolution is 1920x1080x24 \cite[p.~525-526]{gonzalez2008digital} \\
%intro to codec definition
\subsection{Image Codec}
\indent It is clear that storing video data in it's raw form is extremely inefficient, deeming a compression scheme necessary. Such a compression scheme is commonly referred as a codec.
Due to the fact that a video tends to have both high spacial redundancy across a frame and temporal redundancy across multiple frames. A group of neighbouring pixels tends to have
the same or similar pixel intensity values and can be present in multiple frames across a video sequence. This allows the compression scheme to be optimized beyond typical source coding
schemes such as Arithmetic Coding. Therefore, a video codec will efficiently decorelate a video in attempt to remove spacial and temporal redundancies and then perform entropy coding.\\
\indent %As it can be seen in the Figure ~\ref{figure:codec_block_diagram} a video codec can compress a frame in two modes, intra-frame or inter-frame coding. 
Since a video is just a sequence of frames one might want to compress each frame individually by decorrelating the image by applying a 2-D Transform such as Karhunen-Loeve transform(KLT) to sub blocks of the image. KLT has the nice property that it's coefficients are decorrelated and the energy of the block is packed into the minimal amount of coefficients. However it is computationally inefficient since the functions required to compute the transform must be calculated in advance and transmitted to the decoder, rendering its use impractical. Another transform that performs nearly as well as the KLT, but is much more efficient, is the on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The DCT, is a transform similar to the DFT but with real
coefficients, representing a discrete signal in terms of a sum of cosines of different frequencies with the energy concentrated at the few top left coefficients which represent the low frequencies while the higher frequencies components are sparse, with most of the values being close to $0$ as it is illustrated in the Figure \ref{figure:DCTexample}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \subfloat{{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{../figures/16x16_sample_image.pdf} }}

    \caption{A 16x16 sample(a) image and it's DCT coefficients(b) \cite[p.~35]{richardson2002video}}
    \label{figure:DCTexample}
\end{figure} \\
\indent Due to the orthonormality of the transformation, the energy in both image domain and DCT domain is the same, hence no compression is achieved. At the same time due to the energy being concentrated on the low frequency allows for Quantization of the image without significant loss in quality. Furthermore, the human visual cortex is less sensitive to distortions at the high frequencies. Therefore, applying a coarser quntization step, would pass unnoticed by the human eye while improving the compression rate. \\
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../figures/zigzag_reorder_QDCT.pdf}
    \caption{Zigzag scan of Quantized DCT coefficients \cite[p.40]{richardson2002video}}
    \label{figure:zigzag_scan}
\end{wrapfigure}
The non-zero quantized coefficients are being grouped together by the scanning through the block in a zigzag sequence [Figure \ref{figure:zigzag_scan}], since non-zero coefficients are concentrated at the top left. Such scanning would represent the image as short runs of non-zero values followed by a long runs of zero valued coefficients and might be efficiently´represented as pairs by performing Run-Length encoding. Furthermore to represent the frequently occurring runs with shorter codes a type of entropy encoding, such as Huffman or Arithmetic coding, is applied. Ignoring the quantization step would allow a decoder to perfectly recover the original image at the expense of a lower compression, called as well Lossless-compression, while with quantization some of the high frequency information would be irreversibly lost, lossy-compression, but allowing higher compression rates to be achieved. \\ 
\indent The sequence of Transforming, Quantizing, Run-Length and Entropy encoding represents a typical image compression scheme, which would attempt to remove the spacial redundancies in a digital image. Using the DCT as the transform of choice and with additional pre-processing steps such as color space conversions and down-sampling, this image codec is well known under the name JPEG which was standardized in 1992 and could achieve a 10:1 compression ratio \cite{jpeg_nasa}. \\
\section{Video Codec}
\indent As a result, decent compression ratios can be achieved by encoding each video frame with an image codec. However, better compression results can be achieved by exploiting the temporal redundancy as well. This is commonly done by means of frame prediction from previous samples and transmitting the prediction error to the output. Modern Video Compression systems involve more complex ways of predicting a frame by making use of motion estimation, where a region of current frame is compared with neighbouring regions of reconstructed frame in attempt to find the best match of the neighbouring block in the reference frame that gives the smallest residual block, and motion compensation, which subtracts the matched block from the current region \cite[p.~44]{richardson2002video}. In order for the Decoder to reconstruct the frame from the residual, the motion vectors, the location of the matched blocks, has to be transmitted to the decoder, which implies that the decoder is a part of the encoder in a video coding scheme. Figure \ref{figure:codec_block_diagram} represents the typical Video Codec and it clearly illustrates the decoder as being a part of the encoder. \\

  \caption{Typical video codec block diagram\cite[p.~44]{richardson2002video}}
  \label{figure:codec_block_diagram}
\end{figure} \\
A video codec usually encodes the first frame without any prediction ,transmits it to the decoder and stores it for future frame predictions, such a frame is called an Intra-Frame and it is used to kick starts the prediction of the further frames. After the Intra-Frame, the encoder predicts the further frames and transmits only the residual error to the decoder. Furthermore, the frame prediction can be done from future frames, called bidirectional prediction, this however does does not change the general structure of a video codec. The choice of which frames are Intra and which frames are Inter coded is up to the particular standard and coding scheme w.r.t. the trade off between quality and achieved compression. For example, MPEG-2, encodes the 1st frame as Intra-Frame, which is being used to predict the 4th frame, both of which are used to predict the 2nd and third frames as it's displayed in Figure \ref{figure:mpeg2_frame_sequence}. Such an encoding scheme is called Hybrid Motion Compensated Video Encoding.\\

  \caption{MPEG2 frame sequence \cite[p.98]{dsp_henkel}}
  \label{figure:mpeg2_frame_sequence}
\end{figure} \\
\indent Aside from the blocks mentioned above a video frame must be preprocessed. Generally, preprocessing consists in choosing a coding profile, which specifies the quality of the encoded video specifying the color format, since the Human Visual Cortex is more sensible to changes in the luminance than colour, the red and green colours spaces of the YUV format might be sub sampled, for example, for each 4 luminance pixels only 2 chrominance pixels(one red and one green) are taken into account. Aside from the pixel format, the frame gets partitioned into tiles and blocks of various sizes which are then fed into the encoder. %add figure of block partitioning 
\indent In a standardized Video Codec, the decoding process is the one that is fixed in order to ensure the compatibility across a broad range of use cases. Therefore the encoding process must comply but can be further optimized.  \cite{vsp_coursera}
